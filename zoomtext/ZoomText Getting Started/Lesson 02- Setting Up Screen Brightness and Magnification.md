## Setting Up Screen Brightness and Magnification

Since the primary purpose of ZoomText is to make everything larger and easier to see, the first task is to adjust the zoom level (magnification) and screen colors for comfortable viewing.

### Step 1. Screen Brightness

Let’s start by inverting screen brightness. The idea is to reduce glare and provide contrast to make it easier to view items on the screen.

-   Press and hold the **CAPS LOCK** key and then press **C**, or
-   Click the top half of the Color button on the Magnifier tab

### Step 2. Zoom Level

The next step is to find a zoom level that works best for you. When you start ZoomText for the first time, it magnifies the entire screen at 2x magnification. Magnification values range from 1.0x to 60x with incremental steps between 1.0x and 5.0x.

-   To zoom in, press **CAPS LOCK+UP ARROW**
-   To zoom out, press **CAPS LOCK+DOWN ARROW**
-   You can also use the Zoom Level box on the Magnifier tab to change zoom levels.

**Note:** To toggle between the current magnification level and 1x magnification, press **CAPS LOCK+ENTER**. This is a handy way of comparing how much of the display you can actually see when it is magnified.
