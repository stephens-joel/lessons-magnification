Most of the time ZoomText works in the background providing a magnified and enhanced view that follows all of your activity. So as you move the mouse pointer, type text, and navigate your applications, your point of interest is always in view. If you are running ZoomText Magnifier/Reader, ZoomText also echoes and narrates what you are doing, audibly confirming where you are, what you type, and more.

## Starting ZoomText

When you first start ZoomText, the ZoomText toolbar appears, and your screen displays in Full view mode with 2x magnification. If you are running ZoomText Magnifier/Reader, speech is also enabled. If you need to briefly silence speech, press **CTRL**.

## The ZoomText Toolbar

The ZoomText toolbar has a streamlined layout that makes it easy to learn and fast to use. You can access and operate the entire toolbar using the mouse or the keyboard.

Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, you can navigate the ZoomText menu, toolbar tabs, toolbar controls, and button menus. When the focus is on a split button, pressing the **ENTER** key toggles the feature, while pressing the Down arrow expands a list of settings.

When the focus is in the Zoom Level box (on the Magnifier tab) or the Rate box (on the Reader tab), pressing the Up and Down arrow buttons adjust the zoom and rate values and pressing the Left and Right arrow buttons move the focus to the next control. Pressing the **ENTER** key on the Zoom Level box will also toggle the Zoom to 1x magnification.
