# Lesson Plan
## Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science 2020
## Day 1, Ethics
## Prepared by Matthew Salganik, Robin Lee, and Ian Lundberg

### Summary

In this activity, participants will split into small groups, discuss a case study, and then all come together to discuss and debrief.

### Learning objectives

- Participants will practice identifying ethical issues in real or proposed research, discussing ethical issues with colleagues, and proposing changes in research design to improve ethical balance.  
- Participants will get a chance to get to know each other on the first day.

### Participant preparation

There is no participant preparation before this activity.

### Activity

- Split into small groups.
- Read a [case study](https://bdes.datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Patreon-Case-Study.pdf) of researchers facing a decision about research ethics.
- Discuss and answer the four questions in the case study.
- Discuss and answer a fifth question: "Would you personally use the hacked data in this situation?"
- Come back together as a large group and discuss the case and questions.

### Schedule

- 15 minutes: Introduce activity and form groups of about 4 people

- 60 minutes: read and discuss case study in small groups; answer the four questions plus one more: "Would you use the hacked data in your research?"

- 30 minutes: guided discussion of case study by all participants lead by local organizer

### Notes

- Talking about ethics can be difficult for some people. Please keep an open mind, and remember that reasonable people can disagree on many of these topics.

- Try to practice using the concepts that you learned in the discussion.
